= leapclock

+leapclock+ is a simple leap-second aware console clock. It displays system
time, UTC, TAI and local time. The current TAI-UTC offset is obtained from the
+right/UTC+ timezone. UTC and TAI are reconstructed from the system time and
inserted leap seconds are shown as *:59:60.

The system clock is assumed to be synchronized to UTC by NTP. The following
+ntpd+ and +chronyd+ configurations are supported:

- +ntpd+ using the kernel discipline (i.e. no +-x+ option, +tinker step+ larger
  than 0.5 seconds or +disable kernel+ in ntp.conf)
- +chronyd+ with the +leapsecmode+ option set to +system+ (default), +step+ or
  +slew+ on Linux

Requirements:

- ncurses-devel
- up-to-date tzdata
